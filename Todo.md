# IDEA - What do I want to accomplish?

I recently created a Pokemon shiny hunting bot that I had running on twitch for the past two days while I slept. This gave me the idea to create a robot persona that will hang out with chat. Twitch stream features the game and a log explaining what is happening. Since the bot is meant to be on while I sleep I want to keep the chat company. One way is by creating bot persona that seems life like. Think of this as a log bot companion.
